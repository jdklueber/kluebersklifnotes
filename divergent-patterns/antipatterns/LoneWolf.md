# Lone Wolf
## How To Recognize It
* "I can't trust anyone else with this."
* "Nobody else should have to deal with this."
* "I'm all I've got."

## Why It Sucks
It's isolating, and it generally leads to depression and potentially resentment.  Differentiated from [Be The Batman](BeTheBatman.md) primarily in motivation:  The Batman is operating mostly out of pathological guilt or a martyr complex.  Lone Wolf is motivated more by (wording?) an antisocial sense of isolation, or a conviction that nobody else should have to clean up their messes.  Or that nobody would be willing to help.  It's a fine distinction, really.
