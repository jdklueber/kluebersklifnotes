# Trying To Remember Everything
## How To Recognize It
* You have no organizational system for information
* You're constantly forgetting things
* You're constantly in a state of anxiety that you might forget something

## Why It Sucks
* ... see above.
* Your brain isn't actually that great at remembering things... and it knows it.  Trying to keep everything in working memory only goes so far- the more active your life, the more complex your tasks, the less effective your brain will be at cataloguing everything.  You need a system.
