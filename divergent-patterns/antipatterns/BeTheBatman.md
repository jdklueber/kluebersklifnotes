# Be The Batman
## How To Recognize It
"I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be." 

You're pushing yourself too hard- past the point of exhaustion, past even the point of "reasonable heroics."[^1]  If you find yourself in this mode on the regular, rather than in short bursts- and especially if you're doing Be The Batman out of guilt or perceived obligation- it's time to reassess.

## Why It Sucks
* You can't keep this up forever
* Nobody expects this of you
    * Unless they suck
* This behavior leads to significant self inflicted psychological trauma and lashing out in resentment towards those who you ostensibly are caring for/protecting

[^1]: There are situations which do call for pushing yourself past the usual point of exhaustion/reasonable self harm.  "Reasonable heroics" are short term emergencies, not long term patterns.
