# Just Five Minutes - REACTIVE
## Trigger Conditions
You're dreading a task that feels too large for the energy you have.

## Solution
Spend "Just Five Minutes" on the task.  One of two things will happen:  either the task will still feel too big for your cope, or you'll pick up momentum.  In the latter case, congratulations, you're unstuck for now.  In the former... at least you got five minutes more work done.

## Implementations
* If you know what the Next Step is, start there
* Otherwise, figure out the Next Step

## Consequences and Next Steps
Listen to yourself if you're too tired for the work at hand.  Take a short break if you need one.  Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between "I'm exhausted/out of cope" and "this terrifies me and I just don't want to face it."  Just Five Minutes can help you differentiate between the two.
