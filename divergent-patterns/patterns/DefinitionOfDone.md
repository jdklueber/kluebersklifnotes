# Definition Of Done - REACTIVE
## Trigger Conditions
You're resisting getting started on an eternal task (eg, housework) or one that doesn't fit into a reasonable unit of working time (eg, housework.)

## Solution
Come up with an end condition to the work you're committing to that does not involve the task being actually complete (since that would be impossible.)

## Implementations
* "Clean the Bedroom" becomes "fill a bag of trash" or "spend 20 minutes tidying the floor around the door and bed."
* "Write this application" becomes "work on this specific feature" possibly with a time limit.

## Consequences and Next Steps
Don't forget that you still have to keep doing the eternal tasks, or continue working on the large project.  The Definition of Done just means "Definition of Done for NOW."
