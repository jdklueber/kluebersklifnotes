# Breadcrumbs - PROACTIVE
## Trigger Conditions
You have a complex project or task which might not be completed in one push.  

## Solution
Leave Breadcrumbs for yourself.  Breadcrumbs are clues that will help you identify where to pick up your task later if you get interrupted.

## Implementations
* Project documentation: plans, timelines, todo lists
* Todo comments in code
* Flowcharts, sketches

## Consequences and Next Steps
The risk here is feeling like you're spending time on effort you might not need.  

You might not need your seat belt or your source code control either.

But you know from experience that you're going to be damned sorry if you don't have them when you do, and the only way to have them is to put in the effort beforehand.

At the same time, there's a complementary risk of overdoing the breadcrumbs.  Remind yourself to keep to minimum viable product:  breadcrumbs, not a bakery.
