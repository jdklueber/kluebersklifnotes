# The Inbox
## Trigger Conditions
You have things that you don't want to forget, but lack the time to process/categorize properly.

## Solution
Jot them down in an easily accessed and reviewed spot - your Inbox.  *THEN REVIEW IT REGULARLY.*  Inbox Zero is the goal.

## Implementations
* A page in your Engineering Notebook
* A file on your computer
* A notes app on one of your devices
* A dedicated email tag, write emails to yourself

## Consequences and Next Steps
* Pick *ONE* of these
* Review it regularly
* A stale, unreviewed Inbox discourages use and puts you right back to Trying To Remember Everything
