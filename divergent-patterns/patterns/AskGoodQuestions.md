# Ask Good Questions
## Trigger Conditions
* You're in "research mode"
* You're literaling [Asking The Expert](AskTheExpert.md)
* You suspect you're [Amelia Bedelia'ing](../antipatterns/AmeliaBedelia.md)

## Solution
* Wind and rewind the thread in your mind to find the point where confusion begins
* Identify your assumptions - assess what you know, how you know it, and what you only think you know
* Assume everyone can be taken at face value and nobody is an idiot
* Be respectful- this is always a goal, but lean into it right now
* If you're asking an expert for guidance, let them know what independent research or other self help steps you've taken up to this point

## Implementations
* Ask reflecting questions
* "I think things work like this- what do you think?"
* "I think we might be working at cross purposes, can we back up a little bit?"
* "I can't make this work, I've tried these things..." not "IT'S BROKE."
