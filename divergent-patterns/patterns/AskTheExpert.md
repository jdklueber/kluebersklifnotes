# Ask The Expert - REACTIVE/META
## Trigger Conditions
In the literal context, you're at sea and don't know the information you need.

In the meta context, you're trying to decide how to organize things.

## Solution
Literal context:  find someone you trust who knows.  Ask them.

Meta context:  Things belong where they're most used.  

## Implementations
The literal context is too obvious for words, and so does not need further elaboration.  The meta context is more interesting.

In software, classes should own the information they're most responsible for.  This can lead to some confusing tradeoffs, but when combined with the Single Purpose Principle, it leads directly to having a single source of truth for every piece of data.

In other contexts, this can look like placing the kitchen knives next to the cutting work surface, the pens on the writing desk, or other organizational tactics.
