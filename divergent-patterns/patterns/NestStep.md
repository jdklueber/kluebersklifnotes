# Next Step - PROACTIVE
## Trigger Conditions
You have a multi step goal/project. Make sure you don't lose ground because your memory isn't the best.

## Solution
The Next Step is exactly what it sounds like:  it's the next logical thing to do in the workflow.  

## Implementations
If you're already keeping up with [Breadcrumbs](Breadcrumbs.md) then Next Step is just placing a bookmark of some kind in with those.  If you're not using [Breadcrumbs](Breadcrumbs.md) for whatever reason, then make a post it note for your monitor, or a TODO comment in your code (possibly even something like //TODO: NEXT STEP - the next step blah blah blah.)  Some kind of note where you'll naturally find it along with your work.

## Consequences and Next Steps
If you're finding that you have to keep repeating Next Step in an ad hoc fashion, consider implementing [Breadcrumbs](Breadcrumbs.md)
