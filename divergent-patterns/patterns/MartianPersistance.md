# Martian Persistance - REACTIVE
## Trigger Conditions
The problems have gotten too big, but they have to be dealt with without destroying yourself in the process- this isn't the time for a pyrrhic victory.

## Solution
    "At some point, everything’s gonna go south and you’re going to say, this is it. This is how I end. 
    Now, you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That’s all it is. You just begin. You do 
    the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one and then the next. And if you solve enough 
    problems, you get to come home." --The Martian

## Consequences and Next Steps
