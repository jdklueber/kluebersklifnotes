## How To Get Resources (And What They're For)

### Money (Drachmas)

Used for lots of things, but primarily how you'll advance on your Economy/Culture/Military tracks.  Also used to buy (minor) Knowledge Tokens on a Trade action.  Many politics cards also cost money.

Gained by:

* Taxes (at the start of every turn, based on the Tax track)
* Trade Action (based on your Economy track)
* Events
* Politics Cards
* City Developments
* Exploration Rewards

### Knowledge Tokens

Any knowledge token can fill requirements to play a politics card.  Greater Knowledge Tokens are worth points at the end of the game.

Gained by:

* Military Action (costs Troops, only way to gain Greater Knowledge Tokens)
* Trade Action (costs Money, minor tokens only)

### Politics Cards

Various uses but generally:  endgame scoring opportunities, resource generation, other passive effects.

Gained by:

* Legislation Action
* Events
* (other) Politics Cards

### Philosophy Tokens

Three uses:

1. During the Dice phase:  Spend to gain 3 citizens per token spent, as many as you like.
2. During a Politics or Development action, ignore one Knowledge Token requirement for each **pair** of philosophy tokens spent.
3. During the Progress phase:  Buy another level on any track (still costs the money.)

Gained by:

* Philosophy Action
* Events
* Politics Cards
* City Developments
