## Step 1:  Something To Consider

### What kind of story is it?  In what geographical areas will the story take place?  How much ground will the story cover?



### What kind of map do you need to support that story?  What are the most striking features of the landscape?



### Does the story demand any specific locations on the map?



### The Wish List



### Ideas for plot twists?



## Step 4: Make  Sketch

**steps 2-3 in the book are about choosing tools and aren't part of the checklist*

* [ ] Scope of the map decided:  
* [ ] Ratio of land vs water decided:
* [ ] Style of map decided:
* [ ] Crude sketch completed:  [link to image when available]()

[Link to Cartographer files if appropriate]()

* [ ] Weather patterns decided.
* [ ] Mountains added to map.

### Nations featured in your story and what are their sizes?



### What will have to be included on the map because of the cultures in your world?  



### How will the map layout affect the cultures?



### A Bit of Inspiration from the author of Fantasy Map Making

> As promised here is some inspiration when it comes to placing countries. Borders never form randomly, and the following four categories can be used as strong guidelines when you make your decisions. 
>
> **<u>Geology</u>**
>
>  This is the category I have already focused on in the book itself. Mountain ranges, vast deserts, hills, rivers etc. all function exceptionally well as borders. 
>
> **<u>Resources</u>** 
>
> Regions rich in minerals, stones, water, or just fertile soil, can often separate one area from another and thus end up forming borders because one nation wants to protect their resources from the next-door neighbor. 
>
> **<u>Politics</u>** 
>
> This is likely one just as obvious as Geology, but people tend to go to war. The reasons can be many and as a result, borders change. History, as well as maps, are defined by the winners. 
>
> **<u>Religion</u>** 
>
> Religion can, just like politics, affect the placement of borders greatly. If you have territories or structures that are considered sacred, then there is a strong likelihood that conflict and disputes over territory will follow in its wake. It will define borders.
